## 🎯 Project Overview

RaceMind simulates an F1 race in real-time and runs an **AI strategy engine** that:

1. **Monitors** tire degradation, fuel consumption, weather, and position gaps
2. **Simulates** every possible pit stop scenario (20-30 alternatives per lap)
3. **Recommends** the mathematically optimal strategy with confidence scores
4. **Adapts** decisions based on user-selected goals (position, time, or safety)
5. **Learns** from past races to improve future recommendations
6. **Speaks** decisions aloud using a voice race engineer (Web Speech API)
7. **Explains** every recommendation with "Why this decision?" breakdowns
8. **Auto-executes** pit stops when confidence exceeds 85% (in Auto Mode)

This is **NOT a game**. It's a **digital twin** of an F1 pit wall strategy system — the same class of software that decides when Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen should pit.

## 🔄 Technical Workflow

### Phase 1: User Arrives → Landing Page
- Animated hero section with glassmorphism design
- Feature showcase with scroll animations
- "Launch Simulator" button → routes to `/dashboard`

### Phase 2: Dashboard Initializes
- `initialRaceState` loads with default configs (Monaco, Medium tires, P3)
- Weather API fetched for selected track (or climate simulation fallback)
- Audio system unlocked on first user interaction
- AI Panel shows "STANDBY" state with pulsing dots
- **Track Memory** loads from localStorage → shows experience level
- **Strategy Goal** defaults to "Minimize Time"

### Phase 3: Race Simulation (Main Loop)
- User presses **Space** or clicks **Start Simulation**
- `setInterval(simulateLap, 1800)` — fires every 1.8 seconds
- Each tick:
  - Tire wear computed with track-aware physics
  - Lap time predicted from tire state + fuel weight
  - Position battles occur (30% chance, tire-advantage-weighted)
  - Strategy engine runs brute-force optimization
  - AI generates recommendations **adapted to selected goal**
  - **Track memory** boosts confidence (up to +15%)
  - **Auto Strategy** checks if it should auto-pit
  - Audio alerts fire on critical thresholds
  - All 3 charts update in real-time

### Phase 4: User Interaction During Race
- **Pit Stop** (press `P`) — switches compound, resets tire wear
- **What-If Modal** (press `W`) — compare current vs alternative strategy
- **Click AI Recommendation** — expands "Why this decision?" + "If you ignore this"
- **Change Strategy Goal** — switch between Position / Time / Low Risk mid-race
- **Toggle Auto Mode** — let AI take over pit decisions
- **Change Track** — mid-race track switch updates physics model
- **Adjust Weather** — slider changes rain probability, triggers alerts

### Phase 5: Race Completion
- Race finishes at lap 50 → **Race result saved to memory**
- Shows: Final position, positions gained, fastest lap, consistency
- AI Strategy Grade (S/A/B/C/D) based on tire management + position gains
- AI Impact narrative explaining what the strategy achieved
- **Track learning updated** for future races on this circuit

## 🤖 Engineering Approach: Physics-First AI

> **Design philosophy**: RaceMind uses **interpretable, physics-first methods** — the same engineering philosophy used by real F1 pit wall teams. We deliberately chose explainable models over black-box neural networks.

### 1. Deterministic Strategy Optimization (Parameter Sweep)
```
For EACH tire compound (Soft, Medium, Hard, Inter, Wet):
  For EACH possible pit lap (now, +2, +4, +6... +14):
    Simulate entire remaining race with physics engine
    Apply learning bias from past races on this track
    Record total race time
Sort all scenarios → Best strategy = lowest total time
```
- **Technique**: Exhaustive grid search over strategy space
- **Function**: `simulatePitStrategies()` in `data.ts`
- **Scope**: Evaluates 20-30 complete race simulations per decision tick
- **Weather-aware**: In wet conditions, automatically sweeps intermediate and wet compounds

### 2. Parametric Physics Model (Calibrated Regression)
```
wearThisLap = (baseRate + accelFactor × tireAge) × trackAbrasion × thermalMultiplier × wetWearModifier
lapTime = baseTime + compoundOffset + tirePenalty + fuelEffect + gripPenalty + wrongTirePenalty
```
- **Technique**: Parametric regression with coefficients calibrated from real Pirelli data
- **Function**: `computeTireWear()`, `computeLapTime()` in `data.ts`
- **Why this matters**: The quadratic cliff function mirrors real F1 tire behavior; grip factor from weather directly affects lap times (up to +4.4s in heavy rain)

### 3. Multi-Factor Confidence Heuristic
```javascript
const wearFactor = Math.min(30, (100 - tireWear) * 0.4);
const timeFactor = Math.min(40, timeSaved * 3);
let confidence = Math.min(98, Math.round(30 + wearFactor + timeFactor + goalBias));

// Boosted by track memory experience (up to +15%)
confidence = Math.min(98, confidence + trackMemoryBoost);
```
- **Technique**: Weighted scoring heuristic with experience-based calibration
- **Function**: `generateRecommendations()` in `data.ts`

### 4. Threshold-Based Alert System
```
IF tireWear < 20%   → CRITICAL: "Box this lap"
IF rainChance > 60% → WARNING:  "Consider intermediates"
IF fuel < 10kg      → WARNING:  "Fuel save mode"
```
- **Technique**: Rule-based expert system with priority escalation
- **Function**: Threshold checks in `Dashboard.simulateLap()`

### 5. Climate Fallback Model
```
Temperature derived from latitude/longitude using fitted seasonal curves
Rain probability from climate data with stochastic drift per lap
```
- **Technique**: Statistical climate model with random walk perturbation
- **Function**: `generateSimulatedWeather()` in `weatherApi.ts`

### 6. Experience-Based Strategy Refinement
```
After each race → save result to localStorage
Aggregate per-track: optimal pit window, best compound, podium rate
Next race → learned preferences bias the strategy engine's compound and timing choices
```
- **Technique**: Historical aggregation with feedback into the optimization loop
- **Function**: `getStrategyAdjustment()` in `raceMemory.ts`, consumed by `simulatePitStrategies()`
- **How it works**: Learned preferred compounds get a 0.8s bias; pit windows within 2 laps of the historical optimum get a 0.5s bias. This changes *what the strategy engine recommends*, not just a cosmetic score.

### 7. Goal-Conditioned Decision Engine
```
Goal Modifiers:
  maximize-position: { pitBias: +10, aggressiveness: 1.3 }
  minimize-time:     { pitBias:   0, aggressiveness: 1.0 }
  low-risk:          { pitBias:  -8, aggressiveness: 0.6 }
```
- **Technique**: Multi-objective parameterization with user-selectable reward shaping
- **Function**: `goalMod` in `generateRecommendations()`
- **Why this matters**: Same data produces different decisions based on user's objective

### 8. Multi-Car Physics Simulation (Competitor Modeling)
```
19 AI competitors × same physics engine per lap
Each competitor has: skill offset, pre-planned pit schedule, tire compound, cumulative time
Player position = sorted rank by cumulative race time
Gaps computed from actual time deltas, not random values
```
- **Technique**: Agent-based simulation with shared physics
- **Function**: `simulateCompetitorLap()`, `computePositionFromCompetitors()` in `data.ts`
- **Why this matters**: Position, gap ahead, gap behind, and DRS availability are all computed from real physics — not approximated

### Why NOT Neural Networks?

> Real F1 teams (Red Bull, Mercedes, McLaren) **don't use neural networks for race strategy**. They use physics models + optimization sweeps because:
> 1. **Explainability** — Engineers need to tell drivers WHY to pit. A neural network can't explain itself.
> 2. **Accuracy** — Physics is deterministic. A neural net trained on 20 races has too little data.
> 3. **Trust** — A $500M team won't risk a championship on a black box.
> 4. **Adaptability** — Our goal system lets users change objectives mid-race. Neural nets require retraining.

## ⚙️ Physics Engine Deep Dive

### Tire Degradation Model

Each tire compound has 4 physics parameters:

| Parameter | Soft (C5) | Medium (C3) | Hard (C2) | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `baseOffset` | -0.30 | 0.00 | +0.40 | seconds/lap |
| `wearPerLap` | 3.0 | 1.8 | 1.0 | %/lap |
| `wearAccel` | 0.08 | 0.04 | 0.015 | %/lap² |
| `lapTimePenalty` | 0.025 | 0.018 | 0.012 | sec per 1% wear |

**The "cliff" effect**: `wearAccel` creates quadratic degradation — tires seem fine until suddenly they fall off. This matches real F1 behavior.

### Track Abrasion Coefficients

Each circuit multiplies tire wear differently:

| Track | Abrasion | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Bahrain | 1.25× | Sand-blasted surface, most abrasive on calendar |
| Interlagos | 1.20× | Rough, bumpy, anti-clockwise biases left tires |
| Suzuka | 1.15× | Figure-8, constant high-speed loading both sides |
| Barcelona | 1.15× | High-speed final sector destroys rear tires |
| Silverstone | 1.10× | High-speed corners like Copse load tires heavily |
| COTA | 1.10× | Bumpy surface, multi-elevation changes |
| Zandvoort | 1.10× | Banked corners add extra tire stress |
| Spa | 1.05× | Eau Rouge, mixed surface age |
| Hungaroring | 1.00× | Baseline — twisty, low-speed, moderate wear |
| Melbourne | 0.95× | Semi-street circuit, resurfaced |
| Yas Marina | 0.90× | Smooth modern surface |
| Monza | 0.85× | Long straights, low lateral tire load |
| Singapore | 0.85× | Street circuit, low speed, smooth |
| Jeddah | 0.80× | Street circuit, smooth asphalt |
| Monaco | 0.75× | Smooth street circuit, gentle on tires |

### Thermal Wear Multiplier

```javascript
function thermalWearMultiplier(trackTemp: number): number {
  const normalizedTemp = (trackTemp - 35) / 20;  // 35°C = baseline
  return 1.0 + normalizedTemp * 0.12;             // ±12% per 10°C
}
```
- 55°C track → 1.12× wear (hot = faster degradation)
- 25°C track → 0.94× wear (cool = tires last longer)

### Lap Time Formula

```
lapTime = BASE_LAP_TIME + compound_offset + tire_penalty + fuel_effect + noise

Where:
  BASE_LAP_TIME = 75.5s
  tire_penalty  = (100 - tireWear) × compound.lapTimePenalty
  fuel_effect   = -((70 - fuelRemaining) / 70) × 1.4s     (lighter = faster)
  noise         = random ± 0.3s   (driver inconsistency)
```

---

## 💾 Race Memory System

RaceMind stores past race results in **localStorage** and uses them to **learn and improve** future strategy recommendations.

### What Gets Stored (per race)
- Track name, final position, positions gained
- Pit stop count, laps of each pit, compounds used
- Tire wear at each pit stop
- Fastest lap, average lap time, consistency (std dev)
- Weather conditions, whether rain occurred
- AI recommendations followed vs ignored
- Strategy grade (S/A/B/C/D)
- Whether Auto Strategy was used

### Track Learning Engine
After multiple races on the same track, the system aggregates:

| Metric | How It's Learned |
|---|---|
| **Optimal Pit Window** | Average lap of first pit across all races |
| **Best Compound** | Compound used in podium-finishing races |
| **Avg Tire Life** | Estimated laps per stint per compound |
| **Podium Rate** | % of races finishing P1-P3 |
| **Confidence Boost** | Earned from experience (up to +15%) |

### Experience Levels
| Level | Races Required | Confidence Boost |
|---|---|---|
| `NONE` | 0 races | +0% |
| `NOVICE` | 1-4 races | +3-6% |
| `EXPERIENCED` | 5-9 races | +7-11% |
| `EXPERT` | 10+ races | +12-15% |

### AI Panel Display
The AI Panel shows a **Track Memory** bar with:
- Experience badge (NOVICE / EXPERIENCED / EXPERT)
- Confidence boost amount (+8%)
- Track insight: *"📊 3 races learned. Optimal pit window: lap 18. Best compound: MEDIUM."*

## 🎯 Strategy Goal System

Users can choose from 3 strategy goals that **fundamentally change how the AI makes decisions**:

### Goal Options

| Goal | Icon | How AI Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 **Maximize Position** | Target | Aggressive pit timing, boosted overtake confidence (+12), "ATTACK NOW" mode |
| ⏱️ **Minimize Time** | Timer | Pure time-optimal (default), balanced risk assessment |
| 🛡️ **Low Risk** | Shield | Conservative, STAY OUT boosted (+10), reduced pit/overtake confidence |

### Detailed Behavior Changes

```
                    Maximize Position    Minimize Time    Low Risk
Pit Confidence:     +10 bias             Baseline         -8 bias
Overtake Urgency:   +12, URGENT          Standard         -15, HIGH RISK
Risk Tolerance:     Aggressive (0.7)     Neutral (1.0)    Conservative (1.4)
BOX trigger:        If gap < 2s: +8%     Standard         If tires > 35%: -12%
STAY OUT:           Gap management       Time-based       +10, "no risk"
```

### Why This Matters (Presentation Talking Point)
> "The same race data produces completely different AI recommendations depending on the driver's goal. This is Multi-Objective Optimization — the AI isn't just finding one answer, it's finding the right answer for YOUR strategy."

---

## 🤖 Auto Strategy Mode

Toggle between **Manual Mode** and **Auto Mode** during the race.

### How It Works
1. **Manual Mode** (default): You control all pit decisions
2. **Auto Mode**: When AI generates a BOX recommendation with **confidence > 85%**:
   - Automatically executes the pit stop
   - Switches to the recommended compound
   - Shows `🤖 AI AUTO-PIT` in the radio feed
   - Voice engineer announces: *"AI executed pit stop"*
   - **8-lap cooldown** prevents back-to-back auto-pits

### User Override
Even in Auto Mode, the user can always:
- Press `P` to manually pit at any time
- Change tire compound manually
- Switch back to Manual Mode
- Override any AI decision

## ❓ FAQ for Judges

### "Is this using AI/ML?"
> Yes — RaceMind implements **8 distinct computational techniques**: deterministic strategy optimization (exhaustive grid search), parametric physics modeling (calibrated regression), multi-factor confidence heuristics, threshold-based expert system, statistical climate modeling, experience-based strategy refinement (historical aggregation with feedback loop), goal-conditioned decision parameterization, and multi-car agent-based simulation. These are the same categories of techniques used by real F1 pit wall software.

### "Why not use a neural network?"
> Real F1 teams don't use neural networks for pit strategy. Physics-based approaches are the industry standard because they're **explainable**, **deterministic**, and work without massive training data. Our system can tell you *exactly why* it made every decision — a neural network can't.

### "How does the AI learn from experience?"
> After every race, results are saved: position, strategy used, tire performance, weather conditions. The system aggregates this per-track to learn the optimal pit window and best compound sequence. **Critically, this learning feeds back into the strategy engine** — learned compound preferences get a 0.8s bias in the optimization, and pit windows close to the historical optimum get a 0.5s bias. The AI doesn't just remember — it changes what it recommends.

### "How does the Strategy Goal work?"
> Each goal applies mathematical modifiers to the decision engine. "Maximize Position" adds +10 to pit confidence and +12 to overtake urgency. "Low Risk" subtracts confidence and boosts STAY OUT preference by +10. **The same race data produces completely different recommendations** based on the goal.

### "What is Auto Strategy Mode?"
> It's an autonomous AI execution system. When confidence exceeds 85% on a BOX recommendation, the AI automatically executes the pit stop — no human input needed. An 8-lap cooldown prevents rapid re-pitting. The user can ALWAYS override by pressing P.

### "How do position battles work?"
> RaceMind simulates **19 AI competitors** using the same physics engine as the player. Each competitor has a pre-planned pit strategy, individual skill offset, and runs the full tire/fuel model every lap. Position, gap ahead, gap behind, and DRS availability are computed from actual cumulative race times — not estimated.

### "Does weather affect the simulation?"
> Yes, directly. Rain probability maps to a grip factor (1.0 = dry, 0.45 = heavy rain). This grip factor flows into `computeLapTime()` adding up to +4.4s penalty, into `computeTireWear()` accelerating dry-compound degradation in wet, and into the strategy engine which automatically switches to evaluating intermediate and wet compounds when grip drops below 0.9.

### "Where does the data come from?"
> Tire compound parameters are calibrated from published Pirelli degradation curves. Track abrasion coefficients are derived from historical compound selection data. Weather comes from OpenWeatherMap API or our statistical climate model.

### "Why not use Python?"
> By implementing all physics and optimization in TypeScript, the system runs entirely in the browser with **zero latency**, **zero server costs**, and **instant deployment**. The mathematical algorithms work identically in TypeScript — they're math, not library-dependent.

### "What makes this different from a game?"
> Games optimize for fun. We optimize for accuracy. Our tire degradation model uses quadratic cliff functions matching real F1 wear curves. Our strategy engine solves the same optimization problem that real pit wall engineers solve. Our 19 competitors run the same physics — positions are earned, not scripted.

## 📊 Project Summary

RaceMind is a **high-fidelity F1 race strategy simulator** with the following engineering innovations:

1. **🧮 Physics-First Strategy Engine** — 900+ lines of physics formulas modeling tire degradation (quadratic cliff), fuel consumption, grip-dependent lap times, and weather impact. The same deterministic approach used by real F1 pit wall systems.

2. **🏎️ Multi-Car Simulation** — 19 AI competitors run the same physics engine every lap. Position, gaps, and DRS are computed from actual cumulative race times — not approximated. Competitors have varied strategies (1-stop, 2-stop) and individual skill offsets.

3. **🌧️ Weather-Integrated Physics** — Rain probability maps to a grip factor that directly affects lap times (+4.4s in heavy rain), tire wear (dry on wet = +25% degradation), and strategy (engine auto-sweeps wet compounds). Weather doesn't just change text — it changes the math.

4. **💾 Adaptive Strategy Refinement** — Past race results feed back into the optimization engine. Learned compound preferences and pit windows bias future strategy recommendations. The AI doesn't just remember — it changes what it recommends.

5. **🎯 Goal-Conditioned Decision Engine** — Three strategy modes (Position / Time / Risk) apply mathematical modifiers that fundamentally change AI behavior using parameterized reward shaping.

6. **🤖 Autonomous Execution** — Auto Strategy Mode lets the AI execute pit stops when confidence exceeds 85%, with cooldown protection and full user override.

7. **🎙️ Explainable Recommendations** — Every recommendation includes: confidence score, physics reasoning ("Why this decision?"), and consequence modeling ("If you ignore this"). The AI speaks decisions aloud via Web Speech API.

8. **📡 Premium Real-Time UI** — Glassmorphism design with live telemetry, 3 responsive charts, voice race engineer, keyboard shortcuts, and micro-animations.
